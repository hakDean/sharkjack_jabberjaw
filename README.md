# JabberJaw

JabberJaw is a re-code of the famous Shark Jack device developed by Hak5 which turn any OpenWrt compatible router into a portable network attack device.
As the Shark Jack firmware is a slightly modified version of OpenWrt (18.06-SNAPSHOT) it is possible to create your own custom firmware tailored to any router.

### The difference between JabberJaw and Shark Jack.

If the Shark Jack firmware is based on OpenWrt and therefore common to many routers, the hardware is custom made. A special sliding button allows to switch the Shark Jack in Arming mode (payloads management) and in Attack mode (payloads execution). In a classic router we rarely find this kind of functionality. But where JabberJaw makes the difference is that it uses the router's WiFi, where Shark Jack is limited because there is no integrated WiFi. JabberJaw creates a hotspot called "JabberJaw" which is used as the Arming mode of Shark Jack in our case, and the Attack mode is always active and the payload is automatically executed when you connect an Ethernet port to another Ethernet port.

Note: it is also possible to hide the SSID of the Arming mode in order to make JabberJaw undetectable and to be able to connect to it remotely.

Another major problem is the battery, the Shark Jack has a small battery built in (12minutes) where almost all "classic" routers do not. In order to solve this problem, I found 3 options.

 - The first and least convenient one is to simply stick a small
   external battery to the device.
   
  -  The second option is to solder a small battery to the motherboard, in
   almost all travel routers there is a slot for this on the motherboard
   and not used.
   
  -   The last option which is the easiest is to buy the Chinese router
   MPR-A1 (Or A2) which integrates a 1800mah (4hours) battery and that you can
   find on Aliexpress for ~18$.
   - Another easy option is the PQI AirPen (A400) which is more powerful than the MPR-A1 and also includes a 450mah battery. Can be found for around ~15$ on second hand websites.

Last thing, because of limitation on small travel routers I will not implement a GUI to save space. Everything will be managed via SSH. 

### Recommended router.
Note: All router with 4MB of memory flash will need an external USB flash drive to extend the root filesystem. 

Device         | CPU (MHZ)         | Flash MB| RAM MB | Battery | More info|

That's all for now but I'll add more relevant routers later.

### Build your own JabberJaw firmware.

In the following tutorial I will take as example the Buffalo WMR-300 which is a small travel router that I will transform into a Shark Jack device. In your case, adapt the tutorial to your device.

The first thing to do is to clone this repository. Once cloned, letâ€™s download the OpenWrt image builder associate to the right architecture, in my case the architecture used by the WMR-300 is ramips/mt7620. And in order to save a maximum of memory space the version 18 of OpenWrt is recommended.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nwqda/JabberJaw.git
cd JabberJaw
wget https://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/18.06.9/targets/ramips/mt7620/openwrt-imagebuilder-18.06.9-ramips-mt7620.Linux-x86_64.tar.xz
tar xJf openwrt-imagebuilder-18.06.9-ramips-mt7620.Linux-x86_64.tar.xz
```

Before compiling the firmware one important thing to do is to modify the management of the leds. Indeed the Shark Jack uses a combo of several colors (Red, Green, Blue, Mixed) to recognize for example when the device is in the middle of the payload execution and when the execution of the payload is completed the led will change again by another color. And on this point, each device has different configuration. So to handle this it is important to modify the file /usr/bin/LED in order to indicate the correct leds management path. To find out this for your device you can download and decompile an OpenWrt firmware pre-build to your device and look at the different files stored in /sys/class/leds/.

I will write soon a complete article on my blog that will cover this step too.<br>
Update: Here is the detailled article: https://samy.link/blog/jabberjaw-convert-your-router-in-portable-network-attack-dev <br>

File /usr/bin/LED:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Original Shark Jack leds path
RED_LED="/sys/class/leds/shark:red:system/brightness"
GREEN_LED="/sys/class/leds/shark:green:system/brightness"
BLUE_LED="/sys/class/leds/shark:blue:system/brightness"

# Buffalo WMR-300 leds path
# Replace those 3 variables to make it compatible 
# with the LED of your device.
RED_LED="/sys/class/leds/wmr-300:red:aoss/brightness"
GREEN_LED="/sys/class/leds/wmr-300:green:aoss/brightness"
BLUE_LED="/sys/class/leds/wmr-300:green:status/brightness"
```
Once the path of the LEDs correctly filled we can now build the image.
In order to reduce the size of the image as much as possible, since Nmap is quiet heavy (2.2MB), it is important to choose meticulously the packages to include in our firmware. The LUCI GUI web interface will be removed in favor of Nmap which is the cornerstone of JabberJaw.

```bash
cd openwrt-imagebuilder-18.06.9-ramips-mt7620.Linux-x86_64
make image PROFILE=wmr-300 PACKAGES="base-files busybox dnsmasq dropbear firewall fstools bash coreutils-sleep iptables kernel kmod-gpio-button-hotplug kmod-ipt-offload kmod-leds-gpio kmod-mt76 kmod-rt2800-pci kmod-rt2800-soc libc libgcc logd mtd netifd odhcp6c  opkg swconfig uci uclient-fetch wpad-mini nmap macchanger -luci -ppp -ppp-mod-pppoe -ip6tables -odhcpd-ipv6only" FILES=../JabberJaw/wmr-300/
```
Note: This build with packages is only for devices that have at least 8MB of flash memory. For devices with 4MB the initial packages chosen will be different because it will be necessary to have a USB stick connected to the device during the first boot to extend the root filesystem. Once done another script will install the missing dependencies. 
No worries, I will include the right make command for each device. If you need help with this don't hesitate to create a ticket in the "Issues" section.

- The Mac address of the device will change automatically after each reboot.
- All Shark Jack payloads from Hak5 are compatible with JabberJaw.

### Still having difficulties?

Don't worry, you can find in the Releases section all the pre-compiled images!

*Note: For the A5-V11 firmware make sure to insert a USB drive of at least 64mb formatted in Ext4 during the first boot process as the device memory will be extended.

### What's next?

For now, I have included the minimum to run all payloads using Nmap properly. The next step will be to add Tmate (https://tmate.io/) in order to have a remote access on the device and extend the JabberJaw capabilities. Also it is possible, but not sure yet, that I could create a custom web interface to manage some important stuff such as payloads, change password, change the SSID etc.. This will be useful for the uninitiated OpenWrt users.
